##README

* Best to try out several branches from the repo (stable, testing). 
* If possible, don't upgrade. Documentation isn't up to date.
* From what I can tell testing of edge cases is minimal. 
* Better to not mix with other services, use a separate machine/image.

* Do a reboot of MS Windows machines before a clone.
* Disable hybrid sleep/fastboot/fast startup. 
  1. Better compatibility with Linux distros in dualboot scenarios. 
  2. Reduces Windows problems resulting from not being rebooted properly or often enough.
